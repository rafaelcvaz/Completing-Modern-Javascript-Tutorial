# Completing-Modern-Javascript-Tutorial

## Description
Hello, my name is Rafael Vaz. I'm a Biological Sciences student in Brazil changing areas to programming. I have some experience in bioinformatics, but only simple concepts that I want to develop.
I'm completing the [Modern Javascript Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWOYAxlnaww&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9haFPT7J25Q9GRB_ZkFrQAc) in this repository to help me focus and learn the basics of JavaScript.

## Organization
I'm separating the materials in different chapters, each one with a specific theme highlighted in the folder's name. The codes are very simple and made only for educational purposes.

- **Strings and Numbers**
- **Arrays and Objects**
- **Loops and Conditionals**
- **Functions and Methods**
- **DOM Manipulation**
